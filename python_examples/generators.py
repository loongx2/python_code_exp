# A generator is a function that, unlike a regular function that
# always forgets what it has done and starts from beginning each
# time it is called, a generator remembers where it left off and
# continues from there at the next call. In Python, generators
# are an easy way to define lazy sequences that produce their
# elements one element at the time, only doing any work when
# actually asked to do so.

# There is nothing in the laws of nature or man that says that
# a lazy sequence could not just as well be infinite. The users
# of that sequence can (and always should) decorate it with
# itertools.islice to extract the finite prefix instead of
# using more low-level old-timey and non-Pythonic techniques.

# To get started, the classic chestnut of Fibonacci numbers.
# It's like that one is a law of some sorts for CS instructors.
