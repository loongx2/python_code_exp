# Given a sorted list of items, determine whether it contains two
# elements that exactly add up to goal. If parameters i and j are
# given, search only within the sublist from i up to j, inclusive.

# This is an example of technique known as "two pointers". Two
# position indices start from the beginning and end of sequence.
# Each round, one of these indices moves towards the other one,
# maintaining the assumption that if the sequence contained the
# solution in the first place, a solution still remains between
# these indices. Eventually, either a solution will be found, or
# the indices meet in the middle and reduce the problem to its
# trivial base case.
